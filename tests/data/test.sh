# This is a simple example script that doesn't do much.
# The purpose of this script is to serve as an example for line length testing.

echo "Hello, world!" # Standard greeting

# This line is intentionally much longer than 78 characters to serve as an example of an overly long line in a shell script.
echo "This is another line in our simple shell script."
# Yet another long line to make sure we exceed the 78 character limit for this example.

echo "Goodbye, world!" # Standard farewell
